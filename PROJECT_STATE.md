## Current Product Objective

`MVP-1 — First Economically Actionable Case`

Priority strategy source: `PRODUCT_STRATEGY_MVP1.md`

Guiding metric:

`ECONOMIC VALUE x USABLE PRODUCT VALUE / USER TIME`

## Current Working Checkpoint

Branch:

`mvp1-ny-offline-vertical-slice-integrated`

HEAD:

`d94a86f8d774d40c9170f9da2234dd53eb3feff9`

Latest CI:

`35318092067` — SUCCESS.

Classification: `A — Product Critical`.

Current lifecycle has two bounded tracks:

`NY_REQUEST_SUBMITTED_GATE1_CONSUMED -> AWAITING_NY_OSC_ACCESS_INSTRUCTIONS`

and, while that external dependency is pending:

`SYNTHETIC_DOWNSTREAM_SLICE_VERIFIED -> NY_VALUE_EVIDENCE_CONTRACT_VERIFIED -> NY_VALUE_EVIDENCE_VISIBLE_IN_REVIEWER`

## California State

Latest bounded California live run:

`35255228459` — attempt `1` — SUCCESS.

Observed:

- source bytes: `524288`;
- rows examined: `1024` (`256/member`);
- `DEFER_UNCLASSIFIABLE`: `1024`;
- recognized insurance rows: `0`;
- `IN03`: `0`.

California remains `HELD / NOT YET APPROVED`, not rejected. The current California SCO `PROPERTY_TYPE` path is frozen for MVP-1 absent genuinely new evidence.

## New York OSC Owner Name File

Source id:

`ny.osc.unclaimed_funds.owner_name_file`

Registry/source state:

- registered: yes;
- enabled: false;
- approved for use: false;
- acquired: false;
- physical schema: `UNKNOWN_UNTIL_FIRST_AUTHORIZED_FILE`;
- production parser/classification: inactive.

Primary MVP-1 authority target:

`IN03 — Proceeds Due Beneficiaries`

## NY Authorization / Privacy State

### Gate 1 — request access only

`HUMAN_NY_OSC_OWNER_NAME_FILE_REQUEST_LINK_AUTHORIZATION`

State:

`CONSUMED_SINGLE_USE_NON_REUSABLE`

Approval ref:

`OWNER_APPROVAL_2026-09-17_NY_OSC_OWNER_NAME_FILE_REQUEST_LINK_ONLY_5F8B2C71`

The Product Owner confirmed manual submission of the official request once on 2026-09-17. Repository tooling did not independently verify the external submit. Requester contact values are intentionally not persisted.

Access instructions received: no as of the latest Gmail check on 2026-09-18.

### Gate 2 — first bounded download / transient PII

`HUMAN_NY_OSC_OWNER_NAME_FILE_FIRST_DOWNLOAD_TRANSIENT_PII_AUTHORIZATION`

State:

`NOT GRANTED / NOT READY`

Before Gate 2:

1. receive OSC access instructions;
2. observe non-content access/download constraints;
3. define explicit `max_download_bytes`;
4. separately review/authorize one bounded first download and memory-only schema discovery.

No Owner Name File download, real owner PII processing, raw persistence, identity resolution, beneficiary matching, outreach, representation, fee agreement or claim activity is currently authorized.

## Offline MVP-1 Downstream Slice

Integrated onto the current NY branch from the already verified reusable branch rather than rewritten.

Path:

`SYNTHETIC_POST_SCHEMA_MAPPING -> exact NY insurance classification -> IN03 candidate -> economics -> reviewer`

Integration checkpoint:

`75156c5419616b67eff658c8c3c8d6775849546c`

CI:

`35317313977` — SUCCESS.

Verified behavior:

- exact `IN03` -> primary MVP-1 insurance classification;
- other exact recorded NY insurance codes -> insurance/non-primary;
- unknown codes are not promoted by normalization or inference;
- only exact `IN03` creates the narrow synthetic candidate;
- deterministic case id;
- no identity resolution or beneficiary matching;
- no real source or PII access;
- reviewer API and Streamlit surface exercised.

Audit:

`docs/audits/MVP1_SYNTHETIC_VERTICAL_SLICE_OFFLINE.md`

## NY MVP-1 Economics Evidence

Official-source benchmark:

`docs/audits/NY_MVP1_RECOVERABLE_VALUE_EVIDENCE_BENCHMARK_OFFLINE.md`

Current fail-closed product facts:

- Owner Name File does not provide the exact recoverable dollar amount;
- exact recoverable value remains `UNKNOWN_PRE_CLAIM_REVIEW`;
- the 15% figure is represented only as the statutory cap for the scoped APL §1416 location-service rule, subject to legal applicability/exceptions;
- actual fee rate remains unsupported until explicit evidence exists;
- expected follow-up cost remains `NOT_MEASURED`;
- commercial actionability remains `NOT_COMPUTABLE_PRE_CONTACT`;
- no commercial threshold or case value is invented.

Implemented contracts:

- `schemas/economics/ny_mvp1_precontact_evidence.schema.json`;
- `schemas/economics/ny_mvp1_explicit_case_economics_input.schema.json`;
- `schemas/economics/ny_mvp1_explicit_case_economics_result.schema.json`;
- `src/unclaimed_platform/domain/ny_mvp1_value_evidence.py`.

Explicit later arithmetic accepts evidence-backed integer cents and basis points only. It makes no automatic continue/stop recommendation.

Reviewer integration:

- `GET /api/reviewer/mvp1/economics/precontact`;
- fail-closed Streamlit adapter;
- Streamlit `NY PRE-CONTACT ECONOMICS` card.

Latest cumulative CI:

`35318092067` — SUCCESS.

Passed:

- Ruff;
- mypy;
- contract tests;
- smoke tests;
- full pytest;
- Streamlit safety smoke;
- Streamlit startup smoke;
- frontend lint;
- frontend typecheck;
- frontend build.

One prior CI `35317731747` failed only because a unit test and contract test shared the same Python module basename. The contract test was renamed; no product logic changed. Repair CI `35317814189` was SUCCESS.

## Current Product / Source State

- approved real sources: `0`;
- California source: `HELD`;
- NY source: `REGISTERED CANDIDATE / DISABLED / NOT APPROVED / NOT ACQUIRED`;
- NY Gate 1: `CONSUMED / NON-REUSABLE`;
- NY access instructions: pending;
- NY Gate 2: not granted;
- real owner PII processed: no;
- synthetic IN03 classification-to-reviewer path: `READY / VERIFIED`;
- NY pre-contact economics evidence contract: `READY / VERIFIED`;
- real MVP-1 candidates: `0`.

## SINGLE NEXT ACTION

Execute exclusively:

`IMPLEMENT_NY_MVP1_FOLLOW_UP_COST_MEASUREMENT_CONTRACT_OFFLINE`

Classification: `A — Product Critical`.

Goal:

Create a deterministic, provenance-bearing contract for measured per-candidate automated processing cost, source/data cost, human review time and additional manual research effort, using synthetic/test inputs only. This should replace `NOT_MEASURED` only when actual measured evidence later exists.

Do not invent cost assumptions, use real owner data, download the Owner Name File, or weaken Gate 2.
